My old C# from starting around 2021, mainly for college/uni modules

*Projects:*

* Caesar Cipher encryption - Program that takes in a text and shift amount to create a new encrypted text

* 2012 meme maker - Program that takes in a image and two texts to place on the top and bottom of the image to create a "classic meme"-like image
